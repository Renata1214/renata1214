# Hi there, I'm Renata! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a Computer Engineering student at the New York University based in Abu Dhabi. . I enjoy working on innovative projects and continuously learning new technologies as I am 
currently interested on exploring different areas of programming.

ðŸŒ± Throughout my coding time some of the skills or technologies I have worked with include :

   - Object Oriented Programming
    - IoT
    - Data Structures (linked lists, arrays, queues, stacks, vectors, trees, dyanmically allocated memory, graphs, etc)
    - Algorithms (Bubble Sort Algorithm, Quick Sort Algorithm, Djkastra Algorithm, Topological Sorting, Hashing, Breadth First, Depth First Treee Traversal, etc)
    - Arduino, FPGA, M5Stack experience. 
    - Probability and Statistics
    - Linear Algebra
  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to sustainable technology and smart systems.

ðŸ¤” I am currently aiming to learn more on machine learning, hence expect to see soon some of the projects I will be working on to develop my machine learning skills!
    Additionally, I am interested on exploring the area of Robotics, and how can I continue to apply my knowledge in tech to the field of Sustainability. 

âš¡ Just for fun and for others to get to know me better, a random fact about me: 
    I enrolled in a Wildernees Leadership Training program that included a 14 days backpakcing trip in the middle of the woods without more prior experience than a 3 overnight backpack trip,
    and it was one of the greatest time of my life !! (I really like adventures).
